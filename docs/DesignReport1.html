<p><return>
Before we started programming we made a class diagram to get a better overview of the program. When we started working on the program we noticed that the class diagram that we made wasn’t good enough. Therefore we had to make a lot of changes to make the program work perfectly. Below you can see the class diagram that we made before we started programming.  Also, you can see the class diagram for the console application and the web application, that we made after programming.</p>

We decided to make a state diagram to get a better understanding of the behaviour of our program. This was very helpful because it gave us a better overview of how we could design the UI layer, therefore it was easier to implement it.</p>
