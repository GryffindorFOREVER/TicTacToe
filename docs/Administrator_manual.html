<h3 id="deploy-run-and-maintain">Deploy, run and maintain</h3>
<p>When deploying and running the project on a fresh computer it is needed to follow certain steps. </p>
<ol>
<li>A github account is needed.</li>
<li>Fork and then clone the project to the computer. It can be done <a href="https://github.com/GryffindorFOREVER/TicTacToe">here</a>. </li>
<li>Download the JRE(Java Runtime environment)<ul>
<li>It can be downloaded <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To deploy and run the project locally the following command is needed:<ul>
<li><em>./bin/deploy</em></li>
<li>Then you should be able to run the program on this link <a href="localhost:4567">localhost:4567</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The bin folder is useful if it is needed to debug a code that is new. To run scripts in the bin folder it is needed to write <em>/bin/</em> and then the name of the script wanted to be executed. The bin folder holds scripts that are used when running, compiling and deploying the project in separate steps.</li>
<li>Traves CI takes care of pushing new versions on to the Heroku server. Pushing to the github project automatically starts the Travis CI process.</li>
</ol>
