In this project which was done in a course at the University of Reykjavík, the group Gryffindor coded a game of wizarding tic tac toe. 
Wizarding tic tac toe is a two player game where each wizard takes turn in placing their Hogwarts house crest on a 3x3 grid. Gryffindor house gets the honor of always going first. The first house to get three house crests in a row on the grid wins. It does not matter if it is horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If no house gets their crest three times in a row before the grid is full, the game will end in a draw.
